# DarcOS üñ•Ô∏è

**Device Agnostic Runtime Compatible Operating System**

DarcOS is a next-generation operating system focused on true portability and determinism. Built with [WLP4P (Waterloo Language Plus Pointers Plus Procedures)](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/wlp4/), it embraces a minimal, analyzable core while enabling modern systems capabilities through disciplined procedures and memory semantics.

## ‚ú® What is DarcOS?

DarcOS represents a fundamental reimagining of what an operating system can be. We're building a system that prioritizes:

* **Transparency** in cost and behavior
* **Predictability** through deterministic execution
* **True portability** across diverse hardware platforms
* **Minimal surface area** with only essential services

---

## üéØ Core Features

* **Deterministic Execution**: Predictable behavior and performance characteristics through WLP4P's strict semantics and controlled memory management.
* **Device Agnostic**: Runs identically across different hardware platforms without modification, enabling true portability and consistency.
* **Minimal Surface Area**: Small, analyzable kernel with only essential services, reducing complexity and attack surface.
* **Memory Safety**: Controlled pointer semantics and explicit memory management prevent common security vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Compatibility**: Stable runtime surface that abstracts hardware differences while maintaining performance transparency.
* **Formal Verification**: Designed for formal reasoning and verification, enabling mathematical proofs of system properties.

## üé® Web UI Demo

This repository includes a **Canvas Demo** (`/demo`) showcasing DarcOS's interactive capabilities:

* **Interactive Bulletin Board**: Drag-and-drop paper notes with real-time updates
* **Multi-touch Support**: Pinch-to-zoom and two-finger panning for mobile devices
* **Dynamic Content**: Real-time data fetching and persistence
* **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile

The canvas demo serves as a proof-of-concept for DarcOS's user interface capabilities and demonstrates the system's commitment to responsive, intuitive interaction design.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Philosophy

We believe an OS should be **transparent in cost**, **consistent in behavior**, and **approachable to reason about**. DarcOS prioritizes explicit control and verifiability over opaque magic.
